An overview of what we worked on for our first sprint for the Talent Path Pipeline.

## What did I work on this week?
After sharing our presentations last week, we got a lot of feedback that the scope of our project was too large.  That is why this week we decided to focus on scaling down the scope of our project and focusing on what it is we need to include for out MVP.  
Some of the main things that we focused on this week is:
- Creating issues for our Client and Server on our backlog
- Design our database

## What did I learn?
This week I learned about how to structure a database using the https://dbdiagram.io tool.  I also learned the importance of planning before you start a project

## What was difficult?
It was difficult to decide what to take out of our original MVP from last week.  It seemed like we needed everything that we planned on having but we discovered that we had to focus on a smaller scope.  Through the week we discussed how we can add value to our users without having to have a messy app.

## How effective did our team work?
Our team was effective with getting the work that we needed done.  Though it seemed that there was not enough work to do for all of us.

## Additional thoughts on Talent Path Pipeline
After all of our planning, the future of the Talent Path Pipeline is looking bright and I am looking forward to starting to develop this application.
